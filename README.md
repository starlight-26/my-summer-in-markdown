# Summer 2024 -- Kristy

## Who am I?
My name is Kirsty W and I am in 10th grade! Im really excited to make new friends this year and hangout with my old ones. I love the color pink and elephants. Fun fact, my name actually means *ivory* in Thai. My birthday is November 26, that's why I consider the number 26 as my lucky number. I hope that this year will be full of new oppertunities and amazing memories.

## Summer Activities
I did a lot of fun things over the summer. One of the most memerable events I did was ***Colorsplash***. Colorsplash was a Key Club event where we had colored chalk dust and threw it at each other. We all got so colorful! We also had a small market at Colorsplash with different foods and drinks. I ended up eating three whole popsicles and a slice of pizza. Overall, it was my favorite activity of the summer!

I also went to ***Knott's Berry Farm*** with my dad and my brother. We got free tickets from my dad's company so we got to stay later than regular partrons. It was my first time going there! I had a lot of fun going on rides even though my brother was too scared to ride on most of them. My favorite ride was *Los Voladores*. I lived how it felt like soaring through the air!
